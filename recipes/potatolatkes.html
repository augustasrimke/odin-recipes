        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
