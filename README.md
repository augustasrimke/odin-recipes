The current project called "Recipes" is a basic recipe website.

The website consists of a main index page which has links to a few recipes.

The current version of the project 2024.12.20 is not styled with CSS.

The current version of the project 2024.12.29 is styled with CSS Foundations.

I have demonstrated "Git Basics", "HTML Foundations" and "CSS Foundations skills.
